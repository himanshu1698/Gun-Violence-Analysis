# Gun-Violence-Analysis


This study focuses on the gun violence by handguns, including homicide and mass shooting.
US gun violence incidents have been increasing over the years. As US lawmakers continue to pass laws reducing
access to guns. Has there been an impact? Does completely locking down owning guns such as the United Kingdom
or responsible carry laws as seen in several states reduce the number of incidents? Which approach is more effective
at lessening gun violence or are there other factors such as mental illness or unemployment that are more influential
and should be a focus on any upcoming gun laws?
Are stricter gun laws making an impact on the rising number of gun violence incidents within the US? Does restricting
access to guns lessen the total number of gun violence incidents? Or does the ability of an individual to protect
themselves reduce the total number of gun violence incidents? Are there other factors such as mental illness or
unemployment that are a stronger influence on the number of gun violence incidents in the US?
